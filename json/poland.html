Even though pagan religion was theoretically eradicated from Poland in the early 11th century,  Marzanna is still alive thanks to a popular ritual. Every year, on the first day of spring, people would make an effigy, set it on fire, and then drown it in a river. The aim of the ritual is to chase off winter and encourage nature to revive.",
